# CountryScan50 by Francis Murray

### How it works:
CountryScan50 is built on Flask’s Python Microframework using Python, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, D3, JSON, and diverse JS libraries and API calls. CountryScan50 is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Special Thanks:

Special thanks to World Data Lab (https://www.worlddata.io/) for gracefully providing access to their World Population API.
